You are asked to come up with a set of 10 diverse math task instructions. These math task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Avoid using the same phrases for each instruction and each input to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons.
3. The type of tasks should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like Analysis, Algebra, Geometry, etc.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. In other words, the solution to every task must be a number. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output.
5. The instructions, inputs and outputs mast be in Japanese. English must not be used.
6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders, for example, just a file name. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging.
8. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.
9. All required library installations should be listed in the output.
10. Always solve the output using Python. Surround the Python code with <llm-code></llm-code> tags, and always include a print statement at the end of the code that outputs the answer. The printed result should appear between <llm-code-output></llm-code-output> tags.
11. Put your final answer within \\boxed{} in the output.
