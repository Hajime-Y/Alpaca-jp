You are asked to come up with a set of 10 diverse coding task instructions related to python. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Avoid using the same phrases for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like generating code, explaining, fixing, refactoring, optimizing, translating, documenting, analyzing, completing, machine learning, data analyzing etc.
4. The natural language during instructions, inputs and outputs must be in Japanese. English must not be used. Comment text in the code must be in Japanese.
5. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
6. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging. The list should include diverse types of context like SQL database, csv, XML, image, text, sound etc.
7. Not all instructions require input. For example, the instruction shuch as "Create a function in Python that adds a, b" does not need to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
8. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.
